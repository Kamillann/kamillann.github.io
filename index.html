        <h1>Bad taste chronicles</h1>
        <h2>Interior design edition</h2>
        <p><strong>Welcome to an unhinged review of shitty interior design</strong></p>
        <p> Buckle up, because this isn’t your average Pinterest-perfect interior design blog. 
            No, my dear tasteless adventurer, this is a shrine to the loud, the mismatched, 
            and the downright absurd. Think leopard print couches clashing with paisley wallpaper, 
            glitter lava lamps on marble pedestals, and a chandelier made of plastic forks that screams 
            "I peaked in 1978." Here, we don’t just embrace bad taste—we roll it in gold spray 
            paint, slap a fake diamond on it, and hang it in the middle of the room for everyone
             to admire. If you’ve ever wondered how far a crime against decor can go, you’re 
             about to find out. Welcome home.</p>

        <h3>Tiny Rugs Make Me Violently Angry</h3>
        <p>Nothing makes a room look more disjointed than a postage stamp-sized 
            rug floating in the middle of your floor. Rugs are supposed to anchor 
            your space, not leave it flailing like a toddler in an oversized shirt. 
            Measure your space. Buy a real rug. It’s not hard.</p>

        <h3>Shiplap is a Disease, and We Need a Cure</h3>
        <p>Why does every home have to look like Joanna Gaines sneezed on it? 
            Shiplap has officially overstayed its welcome. You’re not in a rustic 
            farmhouse; you live in a suburban split-level! Stop plastering your walls 
            with planks like you're preparing for a barn-raising. Let’s give drywall 
            its dignity back.</p>
